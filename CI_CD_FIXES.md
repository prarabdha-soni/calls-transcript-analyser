# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- **Issue**: Missing `aiosqlite` and `websockets` in requirements.txt
- **Fix**: Added these dependencies to requirements.txt
- **Impact**: Tests can now run with SQLite database locally

### 2. CI/CD Workflow Improvements
- **Issue**: Workflow was missing system dependencies and proper error handling
- **Fixes**:
  - Added system dependencies installation (gcc, g++, libpq-dev)
  - Added test environment file creation
  - Improved mypy configuration with `--ignore-missing-imports`
  - Added `continue-on-error: true` for Codecov upload
  - Simplified Docker build step (removed Docker Hub login requirement)
  - Added better test output with `--tb=short`

### 3. Test Configuration
- **Issue**: Tests were hardcoded to use SQLite only
- **Fix**: Updated conftest.py to use PostgreSQL in CI environment and SQLite locally
- **Added**: Better error handling in test fixtures

### 4. Basic Test Coverage
- **Issue**: No basic tests to ensure core functionality
- **Fix**: Created `tests/test_basic.py` with essential endpoint tests
- **Added**: Health check, API docs, and import tests

### 5. Pytest Configuration
- **Issue**: No proper pytest configuration
- **Fix**: Created `pytest.ini` with proper test discovery and coverage settings

### 6. Local Testing
- **Issue**: No way to test CI locally
- **Fix**: Created `scripts/test_ci.py` for local CI testing

## Files Modified

1. **requirements.txt**
   - Added `aiosqlite==0.19.0`
   - Added `websockets==12.0`

2. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**
   - Added system dependencies installation
   - Improved Python dependency installation
   - Added test environment file creation
   - Enhanced linting configuration
   - Improved test execution
   - Simplified Docker build step

3. **tests/conftest.py**
   - Added CI environment detection
   - Improved database URL selection
   - Enhanced error handling in fixtures

4. **tests/test_basic.py** (new)
   - Basic health check tests
   - API documentation tests
   - Import tests

5. **pytest.ini** (new)
   - Proper test discovery configuration
   - Coverage settings
   - Test markers

6. **scripts/test_ci.py** (new)
   - Local CI testing script
   - Step-by-step verification

## How to Test

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run basic CI steps locally
python scripts/test_ci.py

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run linting
black --check --diff .
isort --check-only --diff .
mypy app/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

### GitHub Actions
The workflow will automatically run on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

## Expected Results

1. **Test Job**: Should pass all linting, basic tests, and coverage checks
2. **Build Job**: Should successfully build Docker image (only on main branch)
3. **Coverage**: Should generate coverage reports and upload to Codecov

## Troubleshooting

If the CI fails:

1. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are available
2. **Database issues**: Verify PostgreSQL service is running in CI
3. **Import errors**: Check for missing imports in app modules
4. **Test failures**: Review test output for specific failures

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub to trigger the CI pipeline
2. Monitor the GitHub Actions tab for results
3. Address any remaining issues based on CI output
4. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for full functionality
