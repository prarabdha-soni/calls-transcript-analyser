Sales Call Analytics System - Technical Details

1. Data Ingestion
- Ingests sales call data, either real or synthetic, including metadata and full transcripts.
- Supports both bulk and streaming ingestion for historical and real-time data.

2. Transcript Processing
- Parses each transcript to separate agent and customer speech.
- Calculates talk ratios to assess conversation balance.
- Extracts key phrases, topics, and conversational patterns.

3. AI-Driven Analytics
- Applies sentiment analysis to customer speech, assigning a sentiment score.
- Generates vector embeddings for semantic similarity and recommendations.
- Provides actionable insights, such as identifying negative calls or suggesting similar calls for training.

4. Data Storage
- Stores all raw data and analytics in a relational database.
- Uses indexes for fast querying by agent, date, sentiment, etc.
- Implements full-text search on transcripts for efficient keyword/topic search.

5. API Layer
- Exposes a RESTful API for external access to data and analytics.
- Endpoints support call listing, detail retrieval, recommendations, and aggregated analytics.
- All endpoints require authentication.

6. Authentication and Security
- Supports user registration and login with secure password storage.
- Uses token-based authentication and role-based access control.

7. Real-Time Features
- Provides real-time sentiment streaming via WebSockets.
- Sends live sentiment updates during calls for supervisor monitoring.

8. Background Processing
- Handles heavy analytics tasks asynchronously to keep the API responsive.
- Processes statistics, reports, and large data batches in the background.

9. Caching and Performance
- Caches frequently accessed data and API responses.
- Uses connection pooling and query optimization for high throughput and low latency.

10. Monitoring and Health Checks
- Includes health check endpoints and internal monitoring for system status.
- Collects performance metrics (response times, error rates, resource usage).

11. Deployment and Scalability
- Containerized for easy deployment and consistent environments.
- Supports horizontal scaling of API and background workers.
- Can add database replicas or cache nodes to handle increased load.

Summary:
The system automates the collection, analysis, and delivery of insights from sales call transcripts, combining data parsing, AI analytics, secure storage, real-time features, and robust APIs to support sales teams and managers with actionable intelligence, while ensuring performance, security, and scalability.
